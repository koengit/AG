First, install MiniSat for Haskell.

The easiest way to do this (right now) is to clone

  git@github.com:nick8325/jukebox.git

and then run

  scripts/minisat-install

This performs all the necessary magic to have MiniSat as a normal Haskell library.

Second, install PSQueues:

  cabal install psqueue
